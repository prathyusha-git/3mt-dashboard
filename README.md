The** Three Minute Thesis (3MT) Retention & Participation Analytics Dashboard** is a data-driven decision-support tool designed to help the Graduate School at K-State understand, evaluate, and strengthen long-term engagement with the 3MT program across colleges and graduate programs.

Built using historical participation data (2016–2025), this dashboard transforms raw records into actionable insights that explain how impactful the 3MT event has been, where participation has remained strong, where it has declined, and how the Graduate School can strategically re-engage programs that have dropped off.

This project/dashboard is all about: 
Which graduate programs consistently participate in 3MT?
Which colleges show a strong culture of engagement?
Where does participation drop after initial involvement? why? how?
Which programs should be prioritized for targeted outreach?
How can participation be revived and stabilized moving forward?
with these questions answered, so that we can plan future 3MT cycles more strategically.

This dashboard enables the Graduate School to:
Design targeted outreach instead of generic promotion of the event for increased success and outreach into the students.
Revive participation from programs that dropped after early involvement
Support graduate student success through data-informed decisions.
