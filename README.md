The** Three Minute Thesis (3MT) Retention & Participation Analytics Dashboard** is a data-driven decision-support tool designed to help the Graduate School at K-State understand, evaluate, and strengthen long-term engagement with the 3MT program across colleges and graduate programs.

Built using historical participation data (2016–2025), this dashboard transforms raw records into actionable insights that explain how impactful the 3MT event has been, where participation has remained strong, where it has declined, and how the Graduate School can strategically re-engage programs that have dropped off.

**This project/dashboard is all about: **
Which graduate programs consistently participate in 3MT?
Which colleges show a strong culture of engagement?
Where does participation drop after initial involvement? why? how?
Which programs should be prioritized for targeted outreach?
How can participation be revived and stabilized moving forward?
with these questions answered, so that we can plan future 3MT cycles more strategically.

## Program Engagement Analytics

This analysis examines how individual graduate programs engage with the 3MT competition over time, focusing on **consistency, continuity, and long-term participation behavior**.

Rather than treating participation as a one-time event, program engagement analytics evaluates:
- How frequently programs return after initial participation
- The length of continuous participation streaks
- Gaps, drop-offs, and re-entry patterns
- Programs that form the long-term “core” of the 3MT ecosystem

By identifying **high-retention programs** and **intermittent or low-engagement programs**, this analysis helps the Graduate School prioritize targeted outreach, faculty engagement, and strategic support efforts to sustain participation.

## Educational Analytics

This analysis evaluates 3MT participation at the **college and institutional level**, shifting focus from individual programs to broader patterns of engagement across academic units.

Institutional analytics answers questions such as:
- Which colleges demonstrate sustained participation in 3MT?
- How evenly is engagement distributed across the institution?
- Where do participation gaps exist at the college level?
- Which colleges may benefit from additional faculty advocacy or targeted support?

By aggregating program-level participation within each college, this view highlights **institutional culture, awareness, and support structures** that influence long-term engagement with 3MT.

These insights enable the Graduate School to align outreach strategies, allocate resources more effectively, and strengthen participation where institutional engagement has been historically inconsistent.


This dashboard enables the Graduate School to:
Design targeted outreach instead of generic promotion of the event for increased success and outreach into the students.
Revive participation from programs that dropped after early involvement
Support graduate student success through data-informed decisions.
